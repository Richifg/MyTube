# MyTube

A custom Youtube player where you can search for videos and watch them.
Functionalities for bookmarking videos and watch history are also implemented.

This project was built with ReactJS, styling is done mostly through Sass and Bootstrap; and state management was implement with MobX.

The project heavily relies on Google's YouTube Data API and manually injected Youtube iframes.
